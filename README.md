## Development environment

In the two original projects the Arduino IDE was used. But here you have to install all libraries manually.
So I decided to use VSCode with the PlatformIO plugin.

**So you can just clone this project and open it in PlatformIO in VSCode.**

The installation of the libraries and the configuration of the board will be done automatically.
